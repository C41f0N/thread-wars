# Thread Wars
Two players stranded in the middle of nowhere with electric powered guns, connected to a single battery. Collect solar cells and build solar panels to charge your guns and defend against the incoming wave of zombies!

## Technical Details
The game is written in C using raylib, and runs each player as a seperate thread. Synchronization is implemented to access raylib's functions with mutual exclusivity as the raylib api is not thread-safe.
